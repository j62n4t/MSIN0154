Student submissions are reviewed/scrutinised by an internal assessor and are available to an External Examiner for further review/scrutiny before consideration by the relevant Examination Board.
It is not uncommon for some students to feel that their submissions deserve higher marks (irrespective of whether they actually deserve higher marks). To help you assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of your submission please refer to   SOM   Assessment   Criteria   Guidelines,   located on the Assessment tab of the SOM Student Information Centre Moodle site.    
The above is an important link as it specifies the criteria for attaining the pass/fail bandings shown below: 
At UG Levels 4, 5 and 6: 
80% to 100%: Outstanding Pass - 1st; 70% to 79%: Excellent Pass - 1st; 60%-69%: Very Good Pass - 2.1; 50% to 59%: Good Pass - 2.2; 40% to 49%:    Satisfactory Pass - 3rd; 20% to 39%:    Insufficient to Pass - Fail; 0% to 19%:    Poor and Insufficient to Pass - Fail. 
At PG Level 7: 
86% to 100%: Outstanding Pass - Distinction; 70% to 85%: Excellent Pass - Distinction; 60%-69%: Good Pass - Merit; 50% to 59%: Satisfactory - Pass; 40% to 49%:    Insufficient to Pass - Fail; 0% to 39%:    Poor and Insufficient to Pass - Fail.
You are strongly advised to review these criteria before you start your work and during your work, and before you submit.
Upon receipt of your mark, you are strongly advised to not   compare your mark with marks of other submissions from your student colleagues. Each submission has its own range of characteristics which differ from others in terms of breadth, scope, depth, insights, and subtleties and nuances. On the surface one submission may appear to be similar to another but invariably, digging beneath the surface reveals a range of differing characteristics.      
Students who wish to request a review of a decision made by the Board of Examiners should refer to the   UCL   Academic   Appeals   Procedure,   taking note of the   acceptable   grounds   for such appeals. 
Note that the purpose of this procedure is not to dispute academic judgement – it is to ensure correct application of UCL’s regulations and procedures. The appeals process is evidence-based and circumstancesmust be supported by independent evidence.

Problem 1: Simple Investment (15 points)
Suppose that you have 400,000 pounds and you are contemplating the purchase of two investments, A and B. One year from now, Investment A can be sold at £X per £1 invested, and Investment B can be sold for £Y per £1 invested. You regard X and Y as statistically independent random variables. Assume that both X and Y are normally distributed with mean of 1.2 and standard deviation of 0.2.
Problem 1.1: Investing in A (5 points)
If you put all your money in Investment A, what is the probability that you will be able to sell it one year from now at a positive profit?
Problem 1.2: Diversification (5 points)
If you split your money between the two investments and invest £100,000 in Investment A and £300,000 in Investment B, what is the probability you will be able to sell your portfolio for a positive profit a year from now?
Problem 1.3: Optimal Diversification (5 points)
Based on Problems 1.1 and 1.2, discuss the optimal strategy for this investment. Please show the calculations if any to support your argument.
Problem 2: Value of Information (10 points)
A manager at an electric car manufacturer needs to make a sourcing decision regarding an electric battery. The manufacturer seeks to produce 100,000 units of its latest electric car model, and each unit will require a single battery. Supplier A can produce the batteries for the price of £4000 per unit. Supplier B can produce the batteries for the price of £2000 per unit. However, Suppliers A and B differ in the quality of the batteries they produce, especially in terms of defect rates.
For Supplier A, the manager believes with complete certainty that all 100,000 batteries will be delivered with no defects. For Supplier B, the manager estimates a 60% probability of no defects, a 30% probability of minor defects being found in the battery shipment, requiring additional rework costs amounting to £250,000,000, and a 10% probability of major defects, requiring additional rework costs amounting to £400,000,000. The electric car manufacturer intends to sell the car at a unit price of £35,000. Besides the battery, each car has a production cost of £28,000, independent of the sourcing decision.
Problem 2.1 (4 points): Sourcing without Additional Information.
Based on the information given so far, please answer the following questions:

•   (1 points) What is the maximum the manager should pay for this information/report? (Hint: compare the results of Problems 2.1.3 and 2.2.3.)
Problem 3: Hypothesis Testing (25 points)
The coffee chain Universal Coffee Lovers (UCL) recently revised its subscription service, the “UCL Club.” Before the change, members were charged £20 per month for unlimited coffee. Under the new policy, members are charged £5 per month, plus £1 for each coffee consumed. To understand how this new subscription model impacts customer behavior, the two CEOs, Akchen and Huang, collected data from club members and asked you to conduct a series of hypothesis tests.
The data file, coffee.csv, is available on Moodle. Please download it and open it by Excel or any other softwares. It contains information on the coffee consumption behavior. of 500 club members before and after the new subscription policy was implemented. The dataset has five columns: the first three columns provide details about each member’s ID, Gender, and Age. In the “Gender” column, the value “1” represents female and “0” represents male. The last two columns report each member’s average daily coffee consumption (in cups) before and after the new subscription took effect. If the consumption value is “-1” in the “After” column, it indicates that the customer has cancelled their subscription. For example, the first club member is a 38-year-old female who previously consumed 1.9 cups of coffee per day under the old subscription policy but has since cancelled her subscription.
Please use the dataset coffee.csv to answer the following questions.
Problem 3.1 (5 points): Gender and Coffee Consumption
The CEOs believe that coffee consumption per customer is not influenced by gender, representing the null hypothesis (H0): there is no difference in coffee consumption between genders. The manager, however, believes that gender does influence coffee consumption, representing the alternative hypothesis (H1): there is a difference in coffee consumption between genders. Using the coffee.csv dataset and coffee consumption data under the old subscription model, do we have enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis?
Problem 3.2 (5 points): Age and Coffee Consumption
The CEOs believe that younger customers are more valuable, asserting that they consume more coffee than older customers. This represents the null hypothesis (H0). In contrast, the manager holds the opposite view, forming the alternative hypothesis (H1). Let µY represent the population mean of coffee consumption for customers aged 20-40, and µO represent the population mean for customers aged 41-60. Using the coffee.csv dataset and the coffee consumption data under the old subscription model, do we have enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis?
Problem 3.3 (5 points): Subscription
The CEOs acknowledge that the new policy may negatively impact customer visits to UCL coffee shops. However, they remain optimistic, believing that the reduction in coffee consumption is modest – less than 0.5 cups per day per customer. This represents the null hypothesis (H0). In contrast, the investors believe the impact is more significant, forming the alternative hypothesis (H1). Using the coffee.csv dataset and considering only the customers who remained in the club under the new subscription model, do we have enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis?
Problem 3.4 (10 points): Policy Evaluation
The investors believe that the new subscription model has led to a decrease in revenue from club members (H0). In contrast, the CEOs believe the opposite (H1), thinking that the new model is boosting the business. The CEOs have asked you to conduct a hypothesis test to support their position based on the existing dataset coffee.csv. How would you approach this analysis?
Problem 4: Discrete Choice Modeling (25 points)
In this problem, we explore an application of probability in a business context, specifically focusing on discrete choice modeling. Discrete choice models are essential tools used to understand product demand and predict consumer behavior. The development of these models earned Daniel McFadden the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2000.
Consider a market with a set of n products. Let N = {1,2,...,n} represent the collection of these n products. Since some products may not be available due to stockouts or inventory limitations, we define an assortment S, which is a subset of N (denoted as S ⊆ N), to represent the set of available products. For instance, if there are five products, N = {1,2,3,4,5}, and a store decides not to sell products 3 and 5, the assortment S would be S = {1,2,4}. Additionally, we use 0 to denote the “no-purchase” option. In this context, i ∈ N refers to the action of “buying product i,” while 0 refers to “not buying anything.” We write N+ = {0} ∪ N = {0,1,2,...,n} and S+ = {0} ∪ S
A choice model M specifies a mapping from any assortment S ⊆ N to a probability distribution PM(· | S) over the N+. Here, PM(i | S) represents the probability that a random customer from the market chooses to buy product i and PM(0 | S) represents the probability that the customer decides not to make any purchase. For example, consider S = {1,2,4}, then PM(1 | S) = 0.3 and PM(0 | S) = 0.2 imply that a customer will buy product 1 with probability 0.3 and will not buy anything from S with probability 0.2.
One of the most fundamental choice models is the Multinomial-Logit (MNL) Model. In this model, each product i is associated with a parameter vi, which represents its expected utility to customers from an economics viewpoint. The no-purchase option is assumed to have an expected utility 0. Given an assortment S of available products, the MNL model calculates the probability that a customer will buy a particular product as follows:
, if i ∈ S,
PMNL(i | S) =	0, if i /∈ S,
, if i = 0.
Problem 4.1 (2 points): Probability Distribution
Please verify that the MNL model results in a valid probability distribution over the set N+.
Problem 4.2 (2 points): When Stockout Happens
Assume that N = {1,2,3} and (v1,v2,v3) = (0.5,0.3,0.7). Please calculate the distribution PMNL(· | N) over N+. If product 2 is out of stock, how will this distribution change?
Problem 4.3 (3 points): Product Demand
Based on your answer to the previous problem, do you think products are substitutes or complements under the MNL model? Discuss this and the limitations of the MNL model.
Problem 4.4 (5 points): Simple Logistic Regression
Now, let’s try to estimate the utility parameter in a simplified scenario. Consider a store that sells a set of products, N = {1,2,...,n}, and assume that these products are always in stock so that S = N = {1,2,...,n}. Suppose m customers visited the store, with m1 customers purchasing product 1, m2 purchasing product 2, and so on, up to mn customers purchasing product n. How would you estimate the utilities (v1,...,vn) in this case?
Problem 4.5 (4 points): Customers Have Their Tastes
Products can be described by their features. Let xrepresent the d-dimensional feature vector of product i. For example, an iPhone 16 Pro priced at £1000, with a 6.7-inch screen and 512GB memory, can be represented by the vector (1000,1,6.7,512), where the features are “price,” “whether it is an iPhone,”“screen size”, and “memory in GB”. Here, a binary value is used to represent “yes” or “no”, with 1 indicating “yes” and 0 indicating “no”.
Given product features x(i) of product i, we assume that the customer’s utility for product i takes the form.d
ui = β0 + Xβk · x(ki), (1)k=1
where each βk is referred to as a partworth parameter. The ui in Equation (1) is known as partworth utility, a numerical score that measures how much each feature of a product influences the customer’s decision to select an alternative.
Now, consider a market of two products, N = {1,2}. Each product is characterized by two features: x(1) = (2,1) for product 1 and x(2) = (1,3) for product 2. Suppose the customer’s partworth parameters are given by (β0,β1,β2) = (1,0.8,−0.2). Answer the following questions:
A.   (2 points) Under the MNL model, what is the probability that the customer chooses to buy product 1 when both products 1 and 2 are available?
B.   (2 points) Which feature, the first or the second, is more likely to be related to price? Explain your reasoning.
Problem 4.6 (5 points): Learning Customers’ Tastes
We aim to estimate the partworth parameters from data. Consider again the simplified version described in Problem 2.4, where assortment S = {1,2,...,n} includes all products, and out of a total of m customers, mi customers purchased product i, for i = 1,...,n. Additionally, each product i is characterized by a feature vector x.
•   (3 points) How would you estimate the partworth parameters (β0,β1,...,βd) in this context? (Note: you can be creative in answering this question)
•   (2 points) Will your suggested method still work if d > n? If not, how would you address this issue?
Problem 4.7 (2 points): Non-linear Utility
The assumption of a linear relationship between a product’s features and its utility has its limitations. For instance, consider a scenario where the partworth parameter for the “screen size” of a phone is positive. This would suggest that increasing the screen size makes customers more likely to buy the phone. However, this assumption breaks down if the screen size becomes excessively large – such as 20 inches, which is bigger than most laptops. Clearly, customers would not be interested in such a phone. How would you address the non-linear relationship between utility and product features in such cases?
Problem 4.8 (2 points): Heterogeneity
Finally, individual customers often have varying preferences. For example, younger customers might prefer smaller phones for convenience, while older customers may favor larger phones for easier readability. This illustrates the heterogeneity in customer preferences. How would you generalize the MNL model to account for such heterogeneity and incorporate diverse customer tastes? Again, you can be creative in answering this question.
Problem 5: Data Collection and Modeling (25 points)
Assume that you plan to open a pizza restaurant in Canary Wharf and would like to study the factors that may affect the restaurant’s revenue. Please briefly discuss your plan, i.e., which factors or variables that you are interested in, and the statistical tools and models that you will need and why.
Please note that you need to discuss at least five factors that may affect the revenue. You should focus on the explanation and justification of your plan and do not need to actually collect the data or carry out the test.
